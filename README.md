****🥔Potato Disease Classification****<br>

This project applies Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to classify potato leaf diseases using the PlantVillage dataset.<br>
The model can predict the following classes:<br>
🌱 Healthy<br>
🍂 Early Blight<br>
🍁 Late Blight<br>

****🚀 Features****
✅ End-to-end pipeline for potato disease classification
✅ Supports both Deep Learning (CNN - TensorFlow/Keras) and Machine Learning (scikit-learn) models
✅ Models saved in multiple formats: .h5, .keras, .pkl
✅ Includes notebook (Disease.ipynb) with:
      Data preprocessing
      Model training
      Model evaluation & results
